<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
 This project 'Crop Monitoring Smart Agriculture' helps farmers to apply the right amount of fertilizers to the fields. A portable device is proposed to be built in this project to measure the required measurements such as temperature, Humidity, Soil moisture, Electric conductivity of soil, NPK, Rainfall and PH. Rainfall is needed to be fetched from an <a href="https://openweathermap.org" target="_blank">API</a> as this includes a portable device. The <a href="#integration-diagram">integration diagram</a> is shown below. The control of the device and visualization of the measurements are done using an Android Application . Data is transferred from the device to Android application via Bluetooth in JSON format by a well-defined API. 
</p>
<p>
An additional feature 'Plant leaf disease detection' is employed within the android application to detect and identify the disease of a plan leaf. This detection and identification provides the farmers with the name of the disease, thus necessary actions could be taken. The sensor data will be transmitted to a cloud server through the internet. The system is required to be compact and energy efficient.

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>This project is mixture of hardware and software components. The hardware part includes the embedded system which programs in Arduino IDE. Arduino Uno is used to build this project. The special sensors used to measure humidity, soil moisture, temperature,ph & soil electric conductivity. LEDs & LCD screen used to indicates the connectivity and the battery level. A bluetooth module is used to communicate with android app. </p>
