<p>This project called as Crop Monitoring Smart Agriculture which helps farmers to apply the right amount of fertilizers to the fields. This project proposes to build a portable device to measure the required measurements such as temperature, Humidity, Soil moisture, Electric conductivity of soil, NPK, Rainfall and PH. Since this is a portable device rainfall needed to be fetch from an <a href="https://openweathermap.org" target="_blank">API</a>. The <a href="#integration-diagram">integration diagram </a>is  shown blow. An android application used to control the device and visualize the measurements. Data transferred from device to Android application via Bluetooth in JSON format by a well-defined API. Plant leaf disease detection is an additional feature which run on the android application can identify the disease name which helps farmers to take the necessary actions. All the sensor data will be transmitted the could server through internet. The needed to be compact and energy efficient. </p>
